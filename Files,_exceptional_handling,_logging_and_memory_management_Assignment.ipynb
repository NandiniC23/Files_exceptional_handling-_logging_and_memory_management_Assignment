        "\n",
        "1. Dynamic typing: Python's dynamic typing system makes it difficult for the interpreter to predict the memory requirements of variables.\n",
        "2. Garbage collection: While Python's garbage collector helps manage memory, it can introduce performance overhead and pauses in the program.\n",
        "3. Reference cycles: Reference cycles can prevent objects from being garbage collected, leading to memory leaks.\n",
        "4. Large data structures: Working with large data structures, such as lists or dictionaries, can consume significant amounts of memory.\n",
        "5. Memory fragmentation: Memory fragmentation can occur when objects are allocated and deallocated in a way that leaves gaps in the memory space.\n",
        ". Memory leaks: Memory leaks can occur when objects are not properly released, causing memory usage to increase over time.\n",
        "7. Performance issues: Poor memory management can lead to performance issues, such as slow execution or crashes.\n",
        "8. Resource exhaustion: Memory exhaustion can occur when the system runs out of memory, causing the program to crash or become unresponsive.\n",
